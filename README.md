A ruby on rails app that helps you keep the memories you create with your best pal. Upload multiple photos using Carrier Wave and tag/ display the locations with the Google Map API. Keep track of your petâ€™s medical records and display it on a chart using Chart.js. This application heavily relied on GitHub for version control, JavaScript, Bootstrap, JQuery, PostgreSQL, HTML5, CSS3 and SCSS.
